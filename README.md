   ```

2. You can create a preview of the notebook in html by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp -f ./node_modules/ploty.js/dist/plotly.min.js ./gh-pages/plotly.js
   jupyter nbconvert --debug --config=./jupyter_nbconvert_config.py --execute --no-input --to=html --output-dir=./gh-pages --output=index ./notebook/dashboard.ipynb
   ```
