# dashboard
A Jupyter notebook that creates a dashboard for viewing LizardByte repository data.

## Notes:
`ploty.js` must exist in the notebooks directory for the dashboard to be viewable by nbviewer.org.
It can be downloaded from their cdn: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/?tab=readme-ov-file#the-script-html-element

You can create a replica of the nbviewer.org dashboard by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook/dashboard.ipynb
```
